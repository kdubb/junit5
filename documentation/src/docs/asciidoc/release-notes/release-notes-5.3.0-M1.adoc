[[release-notes-5.3.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Full stacktrace is printed to the console, when running the `ConsoleLauncher`
  in `--details verbose` mode.
* `ReflectionUtils.findNestedClasses()` and `ReflectionSupport.findNestedClasses()` no
  longer allow a `NoClassDefFoundError` to propagate if a nested class or nested
  interface has an invalid class file. Instead, the error will now be swallowed and
  logged at `WARNING` level.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `junit-platform-gradle-plugin` has been discontinued and is no longer released as
  part of JUnit 5. Please use <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-build-gradle,
  Gradle's native support>> for running tests on the JUnit Platform (requires Gradle 4.6
  or higher) instead.

==== New Features and Improvements

* New overloaded variant of `isAnnotated()` in `AnnotationSupport` that accepts
  `Optional<? extends AnnotatedElement>` instead of `AnnotatedElement`.


[[release-notes-5.3.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* Test discovery no longer halts prematurely if a nested class or nested interface in a
  test class has an invalid class file.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* New support for the IBM AIX operating system in `@EnabledOnOs` and `@DisabledOnOs`.
* New `assertThrows` methods in `Assertions` provide a more specific failure message if
  the supplied lambda expression or method reference returns a result instead of throwing
  an exception.
* New `arguments()` static factory method in the `Arguments` interface that serves as an
  _alias_ for `Arguments.of()`. `arguments()` is intended to be used via `import static`.
* New `get<Class>(index)` Kotlin extension method to make `ArgumentsAccessor` friendlier
  to use from Kotlin.
